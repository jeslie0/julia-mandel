* Julia-mandel
Code for generating Mandelbrot Sets, Julia Sets and tweeting them.

To simply make an Julia Set, compile Julia.c and run "a.out c_real c_imaginary".

To tweet a Julia set image, make sure that tweet.py and Julia.py are in the same folder. Make a Twitter Application and edit the required fields in tweet.py to link it to your account. Then run tweet.py. Requires PILLOW, tweepy.

* Tweet
To tweet a random julia set, you need to first make an account with [[https://developer.twitter.com][https://developer.twitter.com]] and get your API keys. Then, put them into a file (say =keys=) with the following four lines:
#+begin_src conf
<CONSUMER_KEY>
<CONSUMER_SECRET>
<ACCESS_KEY>
<ACCESS_SECRET>
#+end_src

Then call =tweet.py= with this as an argument.
#+begin_src shell
python3 tweet.py keys
#+end_src

This will make and tweet the generated Julia image.

* Nix
This project is packaged as a nix flake. If you use flakes, you can do the following:
#+begin_src shell
nix run github:jeslie0/julia-mandel#juliac <z_real> <z_im> # Generates the julia set for the given complex number
nix run github:jeslie0/julia-mandel#tweet <key_file> # Generates and tweets a Julia Set
#+end_src
