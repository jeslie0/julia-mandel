# Julia-mandel
Code for generating Mandelbrot Sets, Julia Sets and tweeting them.

To simply make an Julia Set, compile Julia.c and run "a.out c_real c_imaginary".

To make the Mandelbrot set, run mandel.py. It requires PILLOW and Python 3.

To tweet a Julia set image, make sure that tweet.py and Julia.py are in the same folder. Make a Twitter Application and edit the required fields in tweet.py to link it to your account. Then run tweet.py. Requires PILLOW, tweepy.
